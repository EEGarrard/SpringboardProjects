Initial Project Ideas

Doggy FourSquare:
A website/app where a user could have a profile for their dog and check in at local dog parks. This would include a search and find function for nearby dog parks and the ability for users to add other dogs as friends. When someone checked in at a dog park, it would ping the dogâ€™s friends to notify them which friend checked in where.
Knitting information repository:
This would be a searchable glossary for all knitting related terms. It would include explanations of different aspects of knitting, as well as video tutorials for certain stitches or techniques, and potentially basic pattern examples.
Jiu Jitsu information repository:
A searchable glossary of jiu jitsu techniques, listed by category. This would also include video tutorials of each technique. Would possibly involve building an API with this information.
Bonus: Local Trivia Finder:
This would list all nearby trivia locations. This would be able to be filtered by location, times, and days. This would possibly involve building an API with this information. -->
